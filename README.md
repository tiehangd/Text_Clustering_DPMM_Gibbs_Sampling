# Text_Clustering_DPMM_Gibbs_Sampling


A python implementation of the text clustering method described in paper "A model-based approach for text clustering with outlier detection", ICDE, 2016. The model performs Gibbs sampling on DPMM model. Based on our experiment, the code can reproduce the results reported in the paper.
